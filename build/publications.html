      "Isosurfaces: Geometry, Topology, and Algorithms" is the book I wrote
      on isosurfaces.&nbsp; Topics include the Marching Cubes algorithm and
      variants, dual contouring algorithms, multilinear interpolation,
      multiresolution isosurface extraction, isosurfaces in four dimensions,
      interval volumes, and contour trees. The book also describes data
      structures for faster isosurface extraction as well as methods for
      selecting significant isovalues.<br/><br/>

            <h2>Constructing Isosurfaces with Sharp Edges and Corners using Cube Merging</h2>
            A, Bhattacharya and R. Wenger. 
            &nbsp; Computer Graphics Forum, 32, 2013, 11-20.<br/>
            A number of papers present algorithms to construct isosurfaces with
            sharp edges and corners from hermite data, i.e. the exact surface
            normals at the exact intersection of the surface and grid edges. 
            We discuss some fundamental problems
            with the previous algorithms and describe a new approach, based on
            merging grid cubes near sharp edges, that produces significantly better
            results. Our algorithm requires only gradients at the grid vertices,
            not at each surface-edge intersection point. We also give a method for
            measuring the correctness of the resulting sharp edges and corners in
            the isosurface.<br/><br/>

            <h2>On the Fractal Dimension of Isosurfaces</h2>

            IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 16, 2010, 1198-1205.<br/>
            The fractal dimension of an isosurface represents the growth in the isosurface as
            the number of grid cubes increases. We define and discuss the fractal isosurface
            dimension, present statistics on the average fractal dimension of 60
            publicly available benchmark data sets, show the fractal dimension is
            highly correlated with topological noise in the benchmark data sets,
            and present a formula predicting the fractal dimension as a function of
            noise.<br/><br/>

            We present the first

            arbitrary simplicial complex K. Our algorithm is randomized with
            an expected running time O(m log n) where m is the size of the
            2-skeleton of K and n is the number of vertices. Our algorithm is
            very simple to implement.<br/><br/>

            We present an algorithm for 
            the   reconstruction      of a surface with boundaries (including a non-orientable 
            one) in three   dimensions   from a sufficiently dense sample. It is guaranteed 
            that the  output is isotopic   to the unknown sampled surface. No previously 
            known algorithm guarantees  isotopic or homeomorphic reconstruction of surfaces
            with boundaries. Our algorithm is surprisingly simple. It `peels' slivers
            greedily from an alpha-complex   of a sample of the surface. No other post-processing
            is necessary. We provide   several experimental results from an implementation
            of our basic algorithm   and also a modified version of it.<br/><br/>

            <h2>Quality Isosurface Mesh Generation Using an Extended Marching Cubes Lookup Table</h2>
            Sundaresan Raman and Rephael Wenger.<br/>
            Computer Graphics Forum, 27, 2008, 791-798.<br/>
            The Marching Cubes Algorithm may return degenerate, zero area isosurface
            triangles, and often returns isosurface triangles with small areas,
            edges or angles. We show how to avoid both problems using an extended
            Marching Cubes lookup table. As opposed to the conventional Marching
            Cubes lookup table, the extended lookup table differentiates scalar
            values equal to the isovalue from scalar values greater than the
            isovalue. The lookup table has 8  =
            6561 entries, based on three possible labels, '-' or '=' or '+',
            of each cube vertex. We present an algorithm based on this lookup table
            which returns an isosurface close to the Marching Cubes isosurface, but
            without any degenerate triangles or any small areas, edges or angles.<br/><br/>

            <h2>Isosurface Construction in Any Dimension Using Convex Hulls</h2>
            Praveen Bhaniramka, Rephael Wenger and Roger Crawfis<br/>
            IEEE Trans. on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 10, 2004, 353-400.<br/><br/>
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> We present an algorithm for constructing isosurfaces in
            any dimension. The input to the algorithm is a set of scalar values in a 
            <i style="">d</i>-dimensional regular grid of
            (topological) hypercubes. The output is a set of (<i style="">d-</i>1)-dimensional
            simplices forming a piecewise linear approximation
            to the isosurface. The algorithm
            constructs the isosurface piecewise within each hypercube in the grid using the
            convex hull of an appropriate set of points. We prove that our algorithm correctly 
            produces a triangulation of a (<i style="">d-</i>1)-manifold with boundary. In
            dimensions three and four, lookup tables with 2<sup>8</sup> and 2<sup>16</sup>
            entries, respectively, can be used to speed the algorithm&#8217;s running time. In
            three dimensions this gives the popular Marching Cubes algorithm.
            We discuss applications of four dimensional
            isosurface construction to time varying isosurfaces, interval volumes and morphing.<br/><br/>

            <h2>Stability of Critical Points with Interval Persistence</h2>
            Tamal K. Dey and Rephael Wenger<br/>
            Discrete and Computational Geometry, 38, 2007, 479-512.<br/><br/>
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Scalar functions defined on a topological space 
            <span style="font-family: Symbol;">W</span>
            are at the core of many applications such as shape matching,
            visualization and physical simulations. Topological persistence is an
            approach to characterizing these functions. It measures how long
            topological structures in the sub-level sets {x&nbsp;in W: f(x) &lt;=
            c} persist as&nbsp;c changes. Recently it was shown that
            the&nbsp;critical values defining a topological structure with
            relatively large persistence remain almost unaffected by small
            perturbations. &nbsp;This result suggests that topological persistence
            is a good measure for matching and comparing scalar functions. We
            extend these results to&nbsp;critical points in the domain by
            redefining persistence and critical points and replacing&nbsp;sub-level
            sets {x in W: f(x) &lt;= c} with&nbsp;interval sets&nbsp;{x&nbsp;in W:
            a &lt;= f(x) &lt; b}. With these modifications we establish a stability
            result for critical points. This result is strengthened for maxima that
            can be used for matching two scalar functions.<br/><br/>

            <h2>Contour Area Filtering of 2-Dimensional Electrophoresis Images</h2>
            Ramakrishnan-Kazhiyur-Mannar, Dominic J Smiraglia, Christoph Plass and Rephael Wenger<br/>
            Medical Image Analysis, 10, 2006, 353-365.<br/><br/>
            <strong>Abstract:</strong> We describe an algorithm, Contour Area Filtering, for separating
            background from foreground in gray scale images. The algorithm is based on the area contained
            within gray scale contour lines. It can
            be viewed as a form of local thresholding, or as a seed growing algorithm, or
            as a type of watershed segmentation. The
            most important feature of the algorithm is that it uses object area to
            determine the segmentation. Thus it is
            relatively impervious to brightness and contrast variations across an image or
            between different images.<br/><br/>
            Contour Area Filtering was designed specifically for image
            analysis of 2D electrophoresis gels, although it can be applied to other gray
            scale images...<br/><br/>

            <strong>Abstract</strong>: ... We report the development of a virtual RLGS method (vRLGS)
            that allows for RLGS spot identification in any sequenced genome and with any
            enzyme combination. We report
            significant improvements in predicting DNA fragment migration patterns by
            incorporating sequence information into the migration models, and demonstrate a
            median Euclidian distance between actual and predicted spot migration of 0.18
            centimeters for the most complex human RLGS pattern. We report the confirmed
            identification of 795 human and 530 mouse RLGS spots for the most commonly used
            enzyme combinations. We also developed a
            method to filter the virtual spots to reduce the number of extra spots seen on
            a virtual profile for both the mouse and human genomes. We demonstrate use of this filter to simplify
            spot cloning and to assist in the identification of spots exhibiting
            tissue-specific methylation...<br/><br/>
